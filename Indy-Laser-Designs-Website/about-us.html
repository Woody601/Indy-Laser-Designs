      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        Indy Laser Designs was established in 2010 on the southside of Indianapolis. Current owners Sean & Amy Wood made
        Indy Laser Designs their own in the fall of 2018. Choosing to remain small by operating out of their home
        office, Sean and Amy are able to offer quality work to their customers with a personalized touch. The goal of
        Indy Laser Designs is two-fold: to help customers celebrate their special occasions and relationships with
        others, while working to build positive relationships with their customers by offering attentive customer
        service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sean and Amy have been lifelong residents of Indianapolis, and their home office is located in
        Beech Grove. While Sean is an Eagle Scout and works full time with the Indianapolis Fire
        Department, Amy manages much of the day-to-day operations with the business. In addition to
        laser engraving, Sean and Amy are able to offer sewing and repair services through an
        additional business called PPE Care & Repair. Please feel free to contact them with any
        questions that you might have. Thank you for stopping by!
